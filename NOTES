# In other to create a main function in the Monty program, the following steps are considered:

- Include the header file monty.h that contains the prototypes of the functions and the data structures for the stack and the queue.
- The main function with two parameters (int argc and char **argv) are defined. These command line arguments represent the number and the name of file that contains the Monty bytecodes.
- Check if argc is not equal to 2. Print the error message USAGE: monty file and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
- Open the file given by argv[1] and check if it is accessible. If not, print an error Error: Can't open file <file> message and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
- Read each line of the file and parse it into an opcode and an optional argument.
- Find the corresponding function for the opcode using a function pointer array or a hash table. If the opcode is not valid, print an error message and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
- Execute the function with a pointer to the stack or queue and the line number as parameters. If the function fails, print an error message and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
- Close the file and free any allocated memory before returning 0.
